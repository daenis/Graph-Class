# Quadratic-Pattern-Recognition
JavaScript code for an object representing a quadratic equation model. Object methods
allow for a complete analysis of a set of x and y coordinates as arrays, including the derivative of the
graph, a, b and c components (under the model f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c), and predictions for values
that are not initially included. 
Stipulation: Coordinate arrays must consist of at least three points that lie next to each other within
             graph (example: x values of x = 3, x = 4, x = 5)
